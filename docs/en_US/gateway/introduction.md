# Multi-Protocol Gateway

This section introduces multi-protocol gateways, including ZMQ gateway, SOME/IP Gateway, and DDS Gateway.

## [ZMQ Gateway](./zmq-gateway.md)

The ZeroMQ (also known as Ã˜MQ, 0MQ, or zmq) gateway allows the bridging of ZMQ applications with MQTT systems.

## [SOME/IP Gateway](./someip-gateway.md)

The SOME/IP gateway is responsible for transforming MQTT messages into SOME/IP messages and vice versa. SOME/IP is a middleware solution for automotive Ethernet-based E/E (electrics/electronics) systems.

## [DDS Gateway](./dds.md)

[DDS](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/About-DDS/) is a standard for high-performance, scalable, real-time, platform-independent, and predictable publish-subscribe messaging. The Object Management Group (OMG) manages the standard. [Cyclone DDS](https://cyclonedds.io/) is a popular implementation of the DDS standard.
